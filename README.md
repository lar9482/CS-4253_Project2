Taught by Dr. Sandip Sen at the University of Tulsa in SP 23.

This repository contains experiments for solving well known constraint satisfaction problems. 
These problems were __Map Coloring__ with at least four colors and a __3x3 Sudoku__ board.

The goal of this project was to compare the advantages and disadvantages of depth first search with backtracking along with various heuristics.
